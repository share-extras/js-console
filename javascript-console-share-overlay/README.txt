Javascript Console Admin Console component for Alfresco Share
=============================================================

Author: Florian Maul

This project defines a Javascript Console component for Share's Administration Console,
that enables the execution of arbitrary javascript code in the repository. 


Installation
------------

The component has been developed to install on top of an existing Alfresco
3.4 or 4.0 installation. There are two different version in this archive with
a specific folder for each of the Alfresco version.

When you have chosen the correct folder (3.4.x or 4.0.x) for your Alfresco version
you'll find two jar files within that folder. The javascript-console-repo.jar needs
to be copied into the Alfresco repository:

  tomcat/webapps/alfresco/WEB-INF/lib/
  
The other file javascript-console-share.jar needs to be copied to the 
corresponding folder in the Share webapp:

  tomcat/webapps/share/WEB-INF/lib/
  
The deployment location has changed recently (with Javascript Console 0.5)
because the Javascript Console now uses Java classes that have to be deployed 
to these locations and can NOT reside in tomcat/shared/lib anymore.


Building
--------

To build the individual JAR files, run the following command from the base 
project directory.

    ant -Dalfresco.sdk.dir=c:\dev\sdks\alfresco-enterprise-sdk-4.0.0 clean dist-jar

The command should build a JAR file named javascript-console-repo.jar or
javascript-console-share.jar in the 'dist' directory within your project.

There also is the javascript-console-dist which builds both jar files and 
creates a patched version for Alfresco 3.4.x which does not support all the 
features of the version for 4.0.x

To deploy the extension files into a local Tomcat instance for testing, you can 
use the hotcopy-tomcat-jar task. You will need to set the tomcat.home
property in Ant.

    ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean hotcopy-tomcat-jar
    
Once you have run this you will need to restart Tomcat so that the classpath 
resources in the JAR file are picked up.


Using the component
-------------------

Log in to Alfresco Share as an admin user and navigate to the Administration
page. Click 'Javascript Console' in the left hand side navigation.
